# Crypto_Clustering

This challenge uses knowledge of Python and Unsupervised Learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. 

The code for this challenge is in the Crypto_Clustering.ipynb notebook.

-Prepared data using the sci-kit learn StandardScaler() module to normalize the data

-Found the best value for k using the original scaled dataframe

-Clustered Cryptocurrencies with K-means using original scaled data

-Optimized clusters with Principal Component Analysis

-Found the best value for K using the PCA data

-Clustered cryptocurrencies with K-Means using PCA data

-Created composite plots to compare the two

-Concluded that the PCA data presented a clearer data cluster


Thanks for viewing!
